## Initial Project: Spanish Patience Solver

The aim of this project is to create two basic libraries and two applications:

- **pip_core:** a core solitaire library
- **pip_search:** a library for searching solitaire deals
- **pip_app:** an application for running a given solver on a user-supplied
  deal
- **pip_analyse:** an application for running analysing solvers and generating 
  experimental results

These will just be for a single solitaire game at this stage: Spanish Patience.
The solver will be simple and the focus will be on a robust and comprehensive
development process.
